# Customer Bank Details and ATM Process
To program an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) to show the Main Menu specified below and perform some Tasks.

## Initialization of pre-processors
```include<stdio.h>
include<stdlib.h>
include<string.h>
```
## Main function 
```
In the main function we are displaying the available options for the Customer and for the ATM depositor.
If the user is a customer then he will be giving his own choice listed above or
if the user is an ATM depositor the he will be giving his choice.
At the first step customer_details_entry() function is called for the updated customer details
so that the transaction for the customers will be initialized.

OUTPUT will be as follows:
-----------Welcome to the ATM service--------------
1. Load cash to ATM
2. Show customer details
3. Show ATM Operations
4. Check ATM Balance
5. Quit
--------------------------------------------------
```

## Task 1 : Load cash to ATM
```
The ATM will be initially empty and we are required to feed money
into the machine, along with specific currency denominations

At first for the time being the available money of the ATM will be 10000.

For the currency denominations a general structure had implemented

struct denominations{
    int two_thousands,five_hundreds,hundreds;

}m;

Like this whenever the ATM cash depositor deposits money, it will be asking according 
to the denominations and then finally adds the total available amount in the ATM.

By calling the load_cash() function in the main fucntion the above task is executed.
It will print the available balance plus the loaded cash and give the denominations 
according to that and give the total.

OUTPUT will be like below:

Enter your choice: 1
Enter the no of Two thousands:  30
Enter the no of Five hundrens:  40
Enter the no of Hundreds:       50

-------------------------------------------------------
Denomination    Number          Value
-------------------------------------------------------
2000            32              64000
-------------------------------------------------------
500             46              18000
-------------------------------------------------------
100             80              8000
-------------------------------------------------------
The total available balance in the ATM is : 100000

```

## Task 2 : Maintain Customer Details
```
To maintain the given customer details in the seperate file I have used structure for their required details.

Structure declaration for customer details is below:
struct customer_entry{
    int acc_no;
    char Name[50];
    int pin;
    int acc_balance;

}s[100]; --> for the time being I have given the size as 100

Then using the function show_customer_details() which is called in the main function 
the following output will be displayed.

Enter your choice: 2
-----------------------------------------------------
Acc_No  Cus_Name Pin    Acc_Bal
